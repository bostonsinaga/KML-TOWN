# KML-TOWN

Hello there,</br>
This is my KML-TOWN software.</br>
A simple and useful '.kml' manipulator program.

WHAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS ARE:
-scan and convert into '.kml' from '.txt' exported WhatsApp chat of share locations with their's date
-manipulate '.kml' such as,
  -change pin icon style with predefined styles
  -set path into placemarks
  -set placemarks into path
  -set paths into one path
  -crop group of placemarks
  -crop path or group of paths
  -filter types of data,
    >pins to folder of them
    >paths to folder of them
    >similar name or descriptions to folder of them
    >similar pin styles or path colors to folder of them
  -create order tags or numbering by direction of start to end location coordinate
  
HOW TO INSTALL:
-compile the source code, by run './compile.[sh, bat]' in CLI (or instead download the pre-compiled 'kml-town' program in 'bin' folder)
-then add compiled program folder (the folder where 'kml-town' program located) to 'path' in your 'Environment Variable'
 (if you don't want to do so, you have to always 'cd' into the program folder every time you using it)
-and finally run 'kml-town' in your CLI
 (type 'kml-town --help' to start)
  
I use this software in my previous job, as a coordinate data entry.
This really help me. And I hope this can help you too. Thank you.
