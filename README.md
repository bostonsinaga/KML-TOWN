# KML-TOWN

Hello there,</br>
I've created software named **KML-TOWN**.</br>
A simple and useful *'.kml'* manipulator program.</br>

**WHAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS ARE:**</br>
-- scan and convert into *'.kml'* from *'.txt'* exported WhatsApp chat of share locations with their's date</br>
-- manipulate *'.kml'* such as,</br>
-- change pin icon style with predefined styles</br>
-- set path into placemarks</br>
-- set placemarks into path</br>
-- set paths into one path</br>
-- crop group of placemarks</br>
-- crop path or group of paths</br>
-- filter types of data:</br>
------ pins to folder of them</br>
------ paths to folder of them</br>
------ similar name or descriptions to folder of them</br>
------ similar pin styles or path colors to folder of them</br>
-- create order tags or numbering by direction of start to end location coordinate</br>

**HOW TO INSTALL:**</br>
-- compile the source code, by run *'./compile.[sh, bat]'* in CLI
---- (or instead download the pre-compiled *'kml-town'* program in *'bin'* folder)</br>
-- then add compiled program folder (the folder where *'kml-town'* program located)
---- to 'path' in your 'Environment Variable'</br>
---- (if you don't want to do so, you have to always *'cd'* into the program folder every time you using it)</br>
-- and finally run *'kml-town'* in your CLI</br>
---- (type *'kml-town --help'* to start)</br>

I use this software in my previous job, as a coordinate data entry.</br>
This really help me. And I hope this can help you too. Thank you.</br>
