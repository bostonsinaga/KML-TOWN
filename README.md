Hello there,</br>
This is my **KML-TOWN** software.</br>
A simple and useful *'.kml'* manipulator program.</br>

**WHAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS ARE:**</br>
**-**scan and convert into *'.kml'* from *'.txt'* exported WhatsApp chat of share locations with their's date</br>
**-**manipulate *'.kml'* such as,</br>
&nbsp;**-**change pin icon style with predefined styles</br>
&nbsp;**-**set path into placemarks</br>
&nbsp;**-**set placemarks into path</br>
&nbsp;**-**set paths into one path</br>
&nbsp;**-**crop group of placemarks</br>
&nbsp;**-**crop path or group of paths</br>
&nbsp;**-**filter types of data,</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**-**pins to folder of them</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**-**paths to folder of them</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**-**similar name or descriptions to folder of them</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**-**similar pin styles or path colors to folder of them</br>
&nbsp;**-**create order tags or numbering by direction of start to end location coordinate</br>
  
**HOW TO INSTALL:**</br>
**-**compile the source code, by run *'./compile.[sh, bat]'* in CLI (or instead download the pre-compiled *'kml-town'* program in *'bin'* folder)</br>
**-**then add compiled program folder (the folder where *'kml-town'* program located) to 'path' in your 'Environment Variable'</br>
 (if you don't want to do so, you have to always *'cd'* into the program folder every time you using it)</br>
**-**and finally run *'kml-town'* in your CLI</br>
 (type *'kml-town --help'* to start)</br>

I use this software in my previous job, as a coordinate data entry.</br>
This really help me. And I hope this can help you too. Thank you.</br>
