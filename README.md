# KML-TOWN

Hello there,</br>
I've created software named **KML-TOWN**.</br>
A simple and useful *'.kml'* manipulator program.</br>

**WHAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS ARE:**</br>
-- **scan** and **convert** into *'.kml'* from *'.txt'* exported **WhatsApp** chat of share locations with their date</br>
-- **manipulate** *'.kml'* such as:</br>
------ change pin icon style with predefined styles</br>
------ set path into placemarks</br>
------ set placemarks into path</br>
------ set paths into one path</br>
------ crop group of placemarks</br>
------ crop path or group of paths</br>
------ filter types of data:</br>
---------- pins into a folder</br>
---------- paths into a folder</br>
---------- similar name or descriptions into a folder</br>
---------- similar pin styles or path colors into a folder</br>
-- **create** order tags or numbering by direction of start to end location coordinate</br>
-- **convert** *'.kml'* into *'.csv'* with folders as *columns* and data as *rows*

**HOW TO INSTALL:**</br>
-- compile the source code, by run *'./compile.[sh, bat]'* in CLI</br>
---- (or instead download the pre-compiled *'kml-town'* program in *'bin'* folder)</br>
-- then add compiled program folder (the folder where *'kml-town'* program located)</br>
---- to 'path' in your 'Environment Variable'</br>
---- (if you don't want to do so, you have to always *'cd'* into the program folder every time you using it)</br>
-- and finally run *'kml-town'* in your CLI</br>
---- (type *'kml-town --help'* to start)</br>

I use this software in my previous job, as a coordinate data entry.</br>
This really help me. And I hope this can help you too. Thank you.</br>
